# Current Understanding

- Issue #348 requests a feature to monitor and optionally interrupt long-running commands
- The feature should:
  - Monitor shell commands every 10 seconds
  - Add context about the command's status to the conversation log
  - Provide an option to kill the command

# Questions to Investigate

- Where in the codebase are shell commands executed?
- Is there an existing mechanism for monitoring command execution?
- How is the conversation log currently implemented?
- What method is used to execute shell commands?
- Is there an existing timeout or interrupt mechanism for commands?
