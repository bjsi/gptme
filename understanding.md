# Current Understanding

- Issue #348 requests a feature for autonomous agents to monitor and optionally interrupt long-running commands without human intervention
- Key requirements:
  - Automatically add periodic status updates (every 10 seconds) to the conversation log
  - These status updates in the conversation log should:
    - Provide context about what the command is doing
    - Indicate if the command is still running
    - Ask the autonomous agent whether it wants to kill the command
- This feature is crucial for autonomous agents debugging commands that might hang, enabling them to make decisions independently based on the conversation log updates
- Shell commands are primarily executed in the `gptme/tools/shell.py` file
  - The `execute_shell` function is the main entry point for executing shell commands
  - It uses a `ShellSession` class to manage the shell environment
    - `ShellSession` manages a persistent bash process using `subprocess.Popen`
    - It uses non-blocking I/O with `select.select` to read output from both stdout and stderr
    - Commands are executed using the `run` and `_run` methods
    - A delimiter is used to detect when a command has finished
  - There's an allowlist mechanism for certain commands that bypass confirmation
  - Non-allowlisted commands use `execute_with_confirmation` for user interaction before execution
  - The actual command execution happens in `execute_shell_impl`
- There's no existing mechanism for adding autonomous periodic status updates to the conversation log or optionally interrupting long-running commands in `ShellSession`
- The conversation log is crucial for communication between the system and the autonomous agent, serving as the basis for the agent's decision-making

# Questions to Investigate

- How can we extend the `ShellSession` class to support autonomous periodic status checks of running commands and add these to the conversation log?
- Can we modify the `_run` method in `ShellSession` to automatically implement periodic status updates in the conversation log every 10 seconds?
- How can we add an optional interruption mechanism to `ShellSession` that allows the autonomous agent to independently decide whether to kill a command based on the conversation log updates?
- Where in the `execute_shell_impl` function should we add the logic for autonomous periodic status updates and optional kill prompts in the conversation log?
- How can we integrate the new autonomous status updates and optional kill prompts with the existing output formatting in `execute_shell_impl` to maintain a clear and informative conversation log for the agent?
- Could we adapt the existing `execute_with_confirmation` mechanism to handle the periodic optional kill prompts in the conversation log for the autonomous agent without human intervention?
- How can we ensure that the autonomous agent can make informed decisions about whether to kill a command based solely on the status updates in the conversation log without human guidance?
- Can we use the non-blocking I/O mechanism in `ShellSession` to implement autonomous periodic checks and add them to the conversation log without blocking the main execution?
- How can we modify the command execution process to allow for optional autonomous interruption based on conversation log updates without breaking the existing functionality or requiring human input interruption based on conversation log updates without breaking the existing functionality or requiring human input?
