# Current Understanding

- The `LogManager` class in `gptme/logmanager.py` is responsible for managing the conversation log.
  - It uses a `Log` class to store messages.
  - The `write` method is responsible for writing the log to a file.
  - The log is stored in JSON Lines format (.jsonl).
- The `append` method is used to add new messages to the log:
  - It appends the message to the log.
  - Calls the `write` method to save the log.
  - Prints the message if it's not marked as quiet.
- The `execute_shell` function in `gptme/tools/shell.py` is the main entry point for executing shell commands.
  - It uses `get_shell_command` to construct the command string.
  - It checks if the command is allowlisted using `is_allowlisted`.
  - For non-allowlisted commands, it uses `execute_with_confirmation` to get user confirmation before execution.
  - The actual execution is done by `execute_shell_impl`.
- `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command.
  - Captures stdout and stderr.
  - Formats the output into a message.
  - Yields a system message with the command output.
- The `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - It uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process.
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell.
- There's no current implementation for monitoring long-running commands or interrupting them.

# Questions to Investigate

1. How can we modify `execute_shell_impl` to monitor long-running commands?
2. Where in the code should we add the periodic status updates to the conversation log?
3. How can we implement an interruption mechanism for long-running commands?
4. What's the best way to measure the duration of a running command?
5. How can we integrate user prompts for potential command interruption?
6. How can we modify the `ShellSession.run` method to support monitoring and interruption?
7. What's the best way to add periodic updates to the `LogManager`?
