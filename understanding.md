# Current Understanding

- Issue #348 requests a feature for autonomous agents to monitor and optionally interrupt long-running commands
- This is particularly important for debugging commands that may hang when an agent is writing code to reproduce and fix issues
- The proposed solution involves:
  - Monitoring shell commands every 10 seconds, as specified in the issue
  - Adding context about the command's status to the conversation log every 10 seconds
  - Providing an option for the agent to decide whether to kill the command based on these status updates
- Shell functionality is implemented in `gptme/tools/shell.py`
- The `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - It uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell
  - It uses `select.select` to read output from stdout and stderr
- The `execute_shell` function is the main entry point for executing shell commands:
  - It uses `get_shell_command` to construct the command string
  - The actual execution is done by `execute_shell_impl`
- The `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command
  - Captures stdout and stderr
  - Formats the output into a message
  - Yields a system message with the command output
- The current implementation doesn't have a built-in mechanism for autonomous monitoring of long-running commands or agent-initiated interruption

# Questions to Investigate

- How can we modify the `ShellSession.run` method to allow for periodic status checks of long-running commands?
- Can we use the existing `select.select` mechanism in `ShellSession._run` to implement a timer for checking command status every 10 seconds?
- How can we modify `execute_shell_impl` to periodically yield status updates for long-running commands to the agent?
- What's the most appropriate way to add these status updates to the conversation log for the agent to process?
- How can we implement a mechanism for the agent to safely interrupt a running command, possibly by sending a signal to the subprocess?
- Are there any existing Python libraries (e.g., `asyncio`) that could help with implementing non-blocking command execution with periodic status checks for agent monitoring?
- How can we ensure that the new monitoring and interruption features don't interfere with the execution of quick commands while still allowing the agent to monitor long-running ones?
- How can we design the interface for the agent to make decisions about interrupting commands based on the status updates?
