# Current Understanding

- The `execute_shell` function in `gptme/tools/shell.py` is the main entry point for executing shell commands
  - It uses `get_shell_command` to construct the command string
  - Actual execution is done by `execute_shell_impl`
- `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command
  - Captures stdout and stderr
  - Formats the output into a message
  - Yields a system message with the command output
- `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - Uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell
- `LogManager` class in `gptme/logmanager.py` manages the conversation log
  - `append` method adds new messages to the log

# Questions to Investigate

1. How is the `execute_shell` function called and what parameters does it accept?
2. What exactly does `get_shell_command` do?
3. How does `ShellSession` handle command execution and output capturing?
4. Is there any existing code related to monitoring long-running commands?
5. How is the `LogManager` integrated with the shell execution process?
