# Current Understanding

- The `execute_shell` function is the main entry point for executing shell commands.
  - It uses `get_shell_command` to construct the command string.
  - It checks if the command is allowlisted using `is_allowlisted`.
  - For non-allowlisted commands, it uses `execute_with_confirmation` to get user confirmation before execution.
  - The actual execution is done by `execute_shell_impl`.
- `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command.
  - Captures stdout and stderr.
  - Formats the output into a message.
  - Yields a system message with the command output.
- The `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - It uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process.
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell.
- There's no current implementation for monitoring long-running commands or interrupting them.

# Questions to Investigate

1. How can we modify `execute_shell_impl` to monitor long-running commands?
2. Where in the code should we add the periodic status updates to the conversation log?
3. How can we implement an interruption mechanism for long-running commands?
4. How is the conversation log structured, and where is it updated?
5. What's the best way to measure the duration of a running command?
6. How can we integrate user prompts for potential command interruption?
