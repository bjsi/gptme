# Current Understanding

- Issue #348 requests a feature for autonomous agents to monitor and optionally interrupt long-running commands
- This is particularly important for debugging commands that may hang
- The proposed solution involves:
  - After running a shell command, add a message to the conversation log every 10 seconds
  - The message should provide context about what the command is doing and whether it's still running
  - It should also ask whether the command should be killed
- This feature is specifically needed for autonomous agents writing code to reproduce and fix issues

# Questions to Investigate

1. How are shell commands currently executed by autonomous agents in the codebase?
2. Is there an existing mechanism for autonomous agents to monitor running commands?
3. How is the conversation log currently implemented and how do autonomous agents interact with it?
4. Are there any existing timeout or interrupt mechanisms for commands that autonomous agents can use?
5. How could we implement a periodic check on a running command that allows an autonomous agent to decide whether to kill it?
6. What information can we gather about a running command to provide context to the autonomous agent?
