# Current Understanding

- The `execute_shell` function in `gptme/tools/shell.py` is the main entry point for executing shell commands
  - It requires arguments: `command`, `args`, `kwargs`, and `confirm`
  - It may not directly call `execute_shell_impl` as we initially thought
- `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Requires arguments: `command`, `_`, and `confirm`
  - Expects three values to unpack, but it's not clear what these values are
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command, but this might not be happening as expected
  - Captures stdout and stderr
  - Formats the output into a message
  - Yields a system message with the command output
- `get_shell_command` function:
  - Requires arguments: `command`, `args`, and `kwargs`
  - Its exact functionality is still unclear
- `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - Uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell, but it might not be called as expected

# Questions to Investigate

1. What are the `args` and `kwargs` parameters used for in `execute_shell` and `get_shell_command`?
2. What is the internal structure of `execute_shell`? How does it process its arguments?
3. What are the three values that `execute_shell_impl` expects to unpack?
4. How does the `confirm` parameter affect the execution of shell commands?
5. What exactly does `get_shell_command` do with its arguments?
6. Why isn't `execute_shell_impl` being called by `execute_shell` in our tests?
7. Why isn't the `run` method of `ShellSession` being called in `execute_shell_impl`?
8. Is there any existing code related to monitoring long-running commands?
9. How is the `LogManager` integrated with the shell execution process?
