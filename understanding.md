# Current Understanding

- Issue 348 requests a way for agents to monitor and optionally interrupt long-running commands.
- The `execute_shell` function in `gptme/tools/shell.py` is the main entry point for executing shell commands.
  - It uses `get_shell_command` to construct the command string.
  - The actual execution is done by `execute_shell_impl`.
- `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command.
  - Captures stdout and stderr.
  - Formats the output into a message.
  - Yields a system message with the command output.
- The `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - It uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process.
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell.
- The `LogManager` class in `gptme/logmanager.py` is responsible for managing the conversation log.
  - The `append` method is used to add new messages to the log.
- There's currently no implementation for monitoring long-running commands or interrupting them.
- The issue suggests adding messages to the conversation log every 10 seconds for long-running commands.

# Questions to Investigate

1. How can we modify `execute_shell_impl` to monitor the duration of running commands?
2. What's the best way to implement a timer for periodic updates (every 10 seconds) during command execution?
3. How can we add these periodic status updates to the conversation log using `LogManager`?
4. What information should be included in the periodic status updates (e.g., execution time, current status)?
5. How can we implement an interruption mechanism for long-running commands?
6. Where in the code should we add the logic to prompt the user about potentially killing a long-running command?
7. How can we modify the `ShellSession.run` method to support monitoring and potential interruption?
8. What's the best way to handle the interruption if the user decides to kill the command?
9. How can we ensure that the monitoring and interruption features don't significantly impact performance for short-running commands?

- The `LogManager` class in `gptme/logmanager.py` is responsible for managing the conversation log.
  - It uses a `Log` class to store messages.
  - The `write` method is responsible for writing the log to a file.
  - The log is stored in JSON Lines format (.jsonl).
- The `append` method is used to add new messages to the log:
  - It appends the message to the log.
  - Calls the `write` method to save the log.
  - Prints the message if it's not marked as quiet.
- The `execute_shell` function in `gptme/tools/shell.py` is the main entry point for executing shell commands.
  - It uses `get_shell_command` to construct the command string.
  - It checks if the command is allowlisted using `is_allowlisted`.
  - For non-allowlisted commands, it uses `execute_with_confirmation` to get user confirmation before execution.
  - The actual execution is done by `execute_shell_impl`.
- `execute_shell_impl` function:
  - Uses a `ShellSession` object to run the command.
  - Captures stdout and stderr.
  - Formats the output into a message.
  - Yields a system message with the command output.
- The `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment:
  - It uses `subprocess.Popen` to create a shell process.
  - The `run` method executes commands in this shell.
- There's no current implementation for monitoring long-running commands or interrupting them.
