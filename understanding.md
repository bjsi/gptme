# Current Understanding

- Issue #348 requests a feature to monitor and optionally interrupt long-running commands
- This is particularly important for debugging commands that may hang
- The proposed solution involves:
  - Monitoring shell commands every 10 seconds
  - Adding context messages to the conversation log about the command's status
  - Providing an option to kill the command
- Current implementation:
  - Shell commands are executed using the `execute_shell` function in `gptme/tools/shell.py`
  - The `ShellSession` class manages the shell environment
  - Commands are run using `shell.run(cmd)` within `execute_shell_impl`
  - There's no current mechanism for monitoring or interrupting long-running commands
  - The implementation uses a generator to yield messages about command execution
- The feature needs to be implemented with autonomous agents in mind, allowing them to monitor and make decisions about long-running commands
- Relevant existing implementation:
  - The `subagent.py` file contains a threading implementation that could be adapted for our needs
  - It uses a `Thread` object to run a subagent asynchronously
  - There's a `subagent_status` function to check the status of a subagent
  - The `subagent_wait` function waits for a subagent to finish with a timeout
- The `ShellSession` class in `shell.py`:
  - Manages a subprocess running a bash shell
  - Uses `subprocess.Popen` to create and interact with the shell process
  - Has a `run` method that executes commands and returns their output
  - Uses `select` to read output from both stdout and stderr
  - Has no built-in mechanism for monitoring long-running commands or interrupting them

# Questions to Investigate

1. How can we modify the `ShellSession.run` method to support periodic status updates?
2. Can we use threading to run the shell command in a separate thread, allowing for monitoring and interruption?
3. How can we implement a timer to check command status every 10 seconds within the `ShellSession` class?
4. What's the best way to safely interrupt a running command in the `ShellSession` class?
5. How can we modify the `execute_shell_impl` function to work with the new monitoring features?
6. Where should we add the logic for deciding whether to kill a long-running command?
7. How can we integrate the status updates with the existing conversation log system?
8. What changes are needed in the `execute_shell` function to support this new feature?
9. How can we ensure this feature works well for autonomous agents?
10. Are there any existing Python libraries that could help with monitoring subprocess execution while maintaining the current functionality?

# Initial Implementation Ideas

1. Modify `ShellSession.run` to accept a callback function for status updates.
2. Create a new method in `ShellSession` for running commands with monitoring (e.g., `run_with_monitoring`).
3. Use threading to run the command execution in a separate thread.
4. Implement a timer using `threading.Timer` to check command status every 10 seconds.
5. Add a method to `ShellSession` for interrupting the current command.
6. Modify `execute_shell_impl` to use the new monitoring features and handle status updates.
7. Update the `execute_shell` function to accept parameters for enabling monitoring and specifying a timeout.
